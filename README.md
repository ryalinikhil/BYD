**Fully Functional Digital Prototype:**
• A working prototype of the BYD app, showcasing the newly integrated Security and Theft
Protection menu.
• This includes the three main features:
• Location and Tracking: Real-time GPS tracking of the vehicle, displayed in a user-friendly map interface.
• Vehicle Behavior Monitoring: Logs and analyzes driving behavior, such as speed range (e.g., 30-70 kmph), frequent routes, and hidden infotainment camera-based drowsiness detection.
This feature also triggers time-sensitive notifications in case of unusual behavior.
• Mark Vehicle as Stolen: A comprehensive anti-thett solution where users can remotely authenticate, view the driver's camera feed, and activate Al autopilot to pull the car over safely, while notifying law enforcement.
